App configuration at the time of the error

Time and date of the error

This information is used solely for diagnosing and improving app performance. The app itself does not collect these logs.

Cookies

Third-Party Services

The app does not use advertisements.

The app does not use third-party analytics.

No personal information is shared with any external services.
